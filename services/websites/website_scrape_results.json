It reflects our commitment to taking every possible measure to safeguard sensitive information and handle it with the care it deserves.Credit decisioning relies on sensitive data, from borrower profiles to alternative signals. That’s why, whether you’re a lender, fintech, or even a loan applicant, you can count on us to protect every piece of data you share.‍What is ISO/IEC 27001:2022?ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is the leading international standard for information security management systems (ISMS).It helps organizations keep sensitive data safe. This includes protecting against unauthorized access, leaks, and cyberattacks.To get certified, a company must follow strict rules across 14 key domains:Access controlCryptographyPhysical and environmental securityCommunications securityOperations managementSystem acquisition, development, and maintenanceInformation security incident managementBusiness continuityComplianceRisk assessment and treatmentHuman resource securityAsset managementSupplier relationshipsSecurity policies and organizationEach domain helps ensure the right controls are in place to protect data.‍Why do companies pursue this certificationIn fields like digital credit scoring and alternative data, where sensitive information is central, strong security practices are essential. Especially when those insights support credit decisions across fintech and lending.Companies invest the time and effort in achieving this certification because it:Proves compliance with global security standards.Builds trust with clients and partners.Reduces risk of data breaches and strengthens internal controls.Supports legal and regulatory compliance, especially in financial services.Earning ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is more than just passing an audit. It requires an independent, accredited body to review and confirm that a company meets the strict standards.‍Why ISO/IEC 27001:2022 matters in 2025-2026Data breaches are rising fast. In 2024 alone, over 1.35 billion people were impacted by data breaches, according to Statista’s research on U.S. data compromises. Many of these breaches happened in financial services.With regulators, clients, and end users watching closely, security is no longer a \"nice to have\". It’s required.At RiskSeal, we handle large volumes of sensitive credit data. That’s why we pursued ISO/IEC 27001:2022: protecting that data is core to maintaining the trust our clients place in us.‍The process behind getting certifiedGetting ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certified isn’t quick. It took us over 8 months of preparation, collaboration, and careful reviews.The process included a multi-stage audit. We implemented new procedures and checked existing ones across all 14 ISO domains. Every team at RiskSeal played a part.Here are a few key areas and what we did to meet the standard:\n  \n    \n      Area\n      Goal\n      What we did to adhere\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Access control\n      To make sure lender data is only seen by authorized personnel.\n      \n        \n          Strengthened access control through advanced penetration testing and 360° system reviews.\n          Reinforced by SIEM and DLP systems to ensure authorized access only.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Operational security\n      To protect the systems we use to power our credit scoring engine.\n      \n        \n          Enhanced network monitoring and incident alerting through DevOps improvements.\n          Initiated improvements to monthly security reviews under CTO oversight.\n          Refined automated security testing layers, including SAST and DAST, for ISO 27001 alignment.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Incident management\n      To be ready to detect and respond to data threats quickly.\n      \n        \n          Designed and implemented a full incident response plan.\n          Completed 6 hours of Security Awareness Training covering phishing, threat response, and social engineering.\n          Implemented regular drills as part of the response cycle.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Compliance\n      To meet legal and regulatory standards like GDPR.\n      \n        \n          Verified alignment with GDPR and equivalent data privacy laws in other regions, including Mexico’s LFPDPPP.\n          Oversaw global compliance alignment across all tools, workflows, and integrations under CTO leadership.\n     ...",

Even among borrowers with little to no credit history.This is exclusive RiskSeal’s research. It offers a data-driven look at how alternative data is reshaping credit risk assessment.‍The context: why Mexico is the perfect test caseMexico’s consumer lending market is growing fast. It reached $323.4 billion in 2024 and is expected to hit $532.7 billion by 2033.The country is also a fintech powerhouse. More than 1,100 fintech companies now operate in Mexico, growing about 4% a year.Their revenues are up 31% year over year, and about 60% focus on underserved consumers with little or no credit history.This mix makes Mexico the perfect place to test how digital data can fill credit gaps. Here, bureau records are often thin or outdated, leaving lenders with an incomplete picture of risk.‍Goal of the researchRiskSeal set out to answer one key question: can digital credit scores reliably predict real-world defaults?To explore this, we partnered with seven lending institutions: three microfinance companies, three BNPL providers, and one neobank. Together, we scored 6.1 million loan applications.The goal was to confirm that digital credit scores aren’t just theoretical but reliably predict real-world defaults.This research was designed to test digital scoring in real lending environments and show how behavioral and device-level data can give lenders a clearer, fairer way to assess risk.‍Target audienceThis research is for credit risk managers, credit providers, and financial institutions. Especially those looking for better ways to assess borrowers when traditional data is scarce.It shows how digital signals can strengthen underwriting models, improve portfolio performance, and expand access to credit for underserved consumers.All results are aggregated and anonymized. No client-specific or personal data is shared.‍What the RiskSeal Digital Credit Score is and what it measuresThe RiskSeal Digital Credit Score is a country-specific, proprietary model built on insights from over 100 million loan applications.It’s a real-time risk signal designed to predict repayment behavior at the exact moment of application.The model evaluates both the number and quality of online services an applicant uses, turning everyday digital activity into a measurable indicator of creditworthiness.Each applicant receives a score from 0 to 999, with higher numbers signaling lower expected risk.\n  \n    \n      Score range\n      Category\n      Interpretation\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0–299\n      Very high risk\n      Frequent red flags and mismatched signals\n    \n    \n      300–499\n      Threshold\n      Elevated risk, requires additional checks\n    \n    \n      500–699\n      Moderate\n      Acceptable risk with some caution\n    \n    \n      700–799\n      Strong\n      Solid applicant profile\n    \n    \n      800–899\n      Excellent\n      Highly reliable digital footprint\n    \n    \n      900–999\n      Outstanding\n      Exceptional trust and stability\n    \n  \n‍These ranges help lenders tailor their workflows, tightening controls for the low end and fast-tracking strong applicants.‍How RiskSeal score is builtThe digital credit scoring model combines over 400 digital signals across key identity dimensions:Email: domain quality, account age, breach exposurePhone: carrier type, SIM stability, VoIP indicatorsIP & device: proxy, VPN, or TOR usage; device reputationLocation & timezone: alignment between declared and observed patternsSubscriptions & eCommerce activity: presence across verified digital servicesWeb registrations & social footprint: signals of consistency and authenticityBreach & fraud markers: traces of compromised or synthetic identitiesEach factor contributes to the score – negative signals lower it, stable ones lift it.RiskSeal’s model is fully transparent.

Therefore, we decided to describe how this technology can benefit credit organizations. ‍The rise of AI in credit organizationsArtificial intelligence technologies are increasingly integrated into various operational processes within credit organizations. ‍According to Statista, in 2030 the profit from their use will amount to $301 billion, while in 2024 it will reach just over half of this amount – $164 billion.For example, the use of NLP – Natural Language Processing – is widespread. According to Markets and Markets, the market size of NLP in the financial sector in 2023 barely exceeded $5 billion. By 2028, it is forecast to increase to $18.8 billion with a CAGR of 27.6%.Lenders are no less widely using machine learning – it has also proven its effectiveness in the banking sector.While AI in the financial industry was estimated to be worth $1.33 billion in 2021, this is projected to increase to $21.27 billion by 2031.‍Use cases for AI in risk managementHow can AI-based technologies be used in credit risk management? The main use cases for them are as follows:Use case #1. Forecasting financial risks and probability of defaultCredit organizations can perform in-depth analyses based on extensive datasets. These include transaction histories, borrower's social media activity, and other unstructured data.Use case #2. Fraud detectionArtificial intelligence can identify suspicious patterns in transactions in real time. Through continuous improvement, AI algorithms are increasingly able to distinguish fraudulent behavior from legitimate actions.Use case #3. Operational risk assessment and managementThe combination of AI-powered advanced data analytics enables financial institutions to automate the assessment of risks associated with business process errors, cyber threats, or third-party activities.Use case #4. AI in loan portfolio monitoringAI can analyze both historical and current loan data. Based on this analysis, AI finds patterns and improves risk predictions.Use case #5. Stress testingAI supports traditional scenario analysis by helping model how macroeconomic factors and lending performance affect each other.For example, AI can find links between inflation and unemployment, and show how they impact the chance of loan defaults.Use case #6. AI-driven customer segmentationAI segments borrowers based on factors like behavior, age, and spending habits.This helps lenders customize credit products for different types of borrowers.‍\n  \n    Predict defaults more accurately\n  \n  \n  using AI\n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n       Book a Demo\n       \n       Book a Demo\n      \n     \n    \n  \n‍The role of AI in credit risk managementAI has tremendous potential in credit risk management. It helps lenders optimize traditional risk models.The use of AI in credit scoring and other forms of credit risk analysis has especially spread with the rise of fintech companies.According to statistics, the AI market size in the fintech industry is estimated at $14.2bn and is forecast to grow to $76.2bn by 2033.That is, the industry will demonstrate a CAGR of 20.5 percent.‍Limitations of traditional credit risk modelsTraditional banks and other lending institutions often rely on standard credit risk models based on historical data to evaluate a potential borrower. These include:Credit ratingIncome levelEmployment historyApplicant's current level of debt, etc.This approach to credit risk management faces some limitations. One of them is the inability to extend credit facilities to unbanked individuals without credit history and traditional rating.This problem is characterized by its global scale, affecting 1.4 billion p...",

But it’s also prime time for fraudsters and impulsive borrowers, creating a high-stakes environment for risk teams.How can you grow approvals without letting risk grow too? This article breaks down modern data strategies that help you approve more and risk less.‍Black Friday borrowing patterns lenders must be ready forBlack Friday isn't just a retail boom. It's also a borrowing boom.And it carries predictable patterns that impact credit portfolios well into the new year.Behavioral drivers like short-term gratification fuel this spending. Consumers often underestimate the long-term cost of their purchases. This leads to significant debt accumulation. The data from recent holiday seasons paints a clear picture of the borrowing patterns around Black Friday:‍Impulse-driven debt. The average Black Friday debt reached $600 per shopper in 2023.Repayment struggles. Around 35% of these borrowers failed to pay off their holiday balances within three months.Delinquency spikes. This spending directly contributed to an 8% rise in delinquencies seen in Q1 2024.‍The surge in BNPL is a clear example of how fast holiday lending moves. These platforms offer instant approvals, which is why they fueled nearly $10 billion in Black Friday sales in 2023.This growth creates both opportunity and risk.On one hand, BNPL expands access to credit at scale. On the other, it makes accurate credit risk scoring for BNPL essential during peak shopping periods.Black Friday floods the pipeline with applications that need decisions in seconds. Traditional credit models can’t keep up. Bureau data is slow to update and offers limited insight into new or underserved borrowersThat leaves lenders with a difficult choice. Approve too quickly and risk rising fraud and defaults. Approve too cautiously and lose valuable business to competitors.‍5 credit portfolio risks lenders can’t ignore when preparing for Black Friday​The seasonal surge in borrowing introduces five critical risks for lenders.These risks compound over time and put pressure on portfolio performance as the new year begins.‍Rising loan defaults. Holiday-driven borrowing often leads to higher default rates in the following months.Delayed repayments. Prolonged repayment timelines increase exposure to non-performing loans and strain collections.Portfolio delinquency spikes. Q1 consistently brings a predictable rise in delinquency rates as holiday balances come due.Cross-product overextension. Borrowers often layer debt across different credit providers, raising the likelihood of multi-account defaults.Erosion of portfolio health. Taken together, these trends weaken overall credit portfolio performance.‍With delinquencies approaching five-year highs in early 2025, lenders face pressure on both profitability and resilience.The short-term revenue boost from holiday lending can quickly be offset by long-term credit losses and operational strain.‍How to prepare your business for Black FridayTraditional bureau data still plays a role in risk assessment. But during fast-moving periods like Black Friday, it’s too slow and incomplete.Credit reports often take 30-60 days to reflect new obligations or missed payments. This leaves a blind spot when activity spikes.New arrivals, younger borrowers, or those who avoid traditional credit may be strong candidates, but bureau-only models overlook them.Relying solely on scores risks unnecessary rejections. Real-time alternative data closes this gap.Digital signals allow lenders to make faster, more accurate, and more inclusive decisions at scale.‍Fight application fraud before the damage is doneFraudsters often rely on volume. They submit large numbers of fake applications, hoping some will bypass outdated systems.This clogs pipelines, wastes underwriting resources, and increases the risk of funding fraudulent accounts.Real-time signals help filter these applications instantly:Email and phone data. Legitimate borrowers tend to use long-standing email addresses and numbers. RiskSeal includes email age ...",

Together, we scored 6.1 million loan applications.The goal was to confirm that digital credit scores aren’t just theoretical but reliably predict real-world defaults.This research was designed to test digital scoring in real lending environments and show how behavioral and device-level data can give lenders a clearer, fairer way to assess risk.‍Target audienceThis research is for credit risk managers, credit providers, and financial institutions.

Deep-subprime borrowers account for 45% of originations. Subprime borrowers make up another 16%. Approval rates remain high. 78% of applications from subprime or deep-subprime consumers approved.This makes risk management a key priority for BNPL providers. In this article, we take an in-depth look at the challenges and emerging risks they face every day.‍Customer risks in the BNPL business modelBNPL’s success is built on speed, simplicity, and frictionless user experience. But those same strengths introduce new credit risk vulnerabilities.Affordability vs. impulsivityBreaking payments into small installments can make it hard to tell if a customer is borrowing responsibly or taking on too much.‍Many BNPL users rely on the service to access credit quickly. Especially during stressful life events. In fact, 76% of those who missed a BNPL payment had experienced one or more major life events in the past year.Impulse purchases are also common during seasonal sales. This is when ads and marketing promotions encourage quick spending. BNPL providers must manage risk while keeping onboarding and approval processes fast. Even at a huge sales-driven scale.Thin-file borrowersBNPL attracts many credit-invisible consumers. Some of these consumers may be financially responsible, but for most, their credit behavior is unknown. These include:Renters with no mortgage recordSavers who avoid credit cardsFreelancers without salaried incomeExcluding such applicants can lead to missed growth opportunities. But approving them blindly creates elevated risk. Credit providers must therefore enrich bureau scores with alternative digital signals in BNPL to solve the credit invisibility issue.Repayment behavior complexitySome BNPL defaults aren’t caused by financial hardship but by behavioral deprioritization. Because BNPL is perceived as low-stakes, certain customers treat repayments as optional. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine distress from opportunistic default.Payment stacking and hidden leverageA growing challenge is BNPL stacking. This happens when consumers take out loans across multiple BNPL providers at once.Nearly 60% of young users (18-28) have between two and five BNPL plans simultaneously. Often without fully realizing their cumulative obligations.Traditional credit bureaus don’t yet fully capture BNPL exposures, leaving lenders blind to aggregate risk. Providers are increasingly sharing data with each other to spot hidden debt quickly.Income volatilityBNPL adoption is especially high among people whose income streams fluctuate significantly.Their risk profiles are dynamic month to month. This requires continuous monitoring rather than static underwriting at loan origination.In today’s economy, many people juggle multiple gigs, side hustles, and alternative income sources. Credit bureaus often cannot track this.Without leveraging behavioral data in lending to closely monitor a person’s financial behavior and spending habits, risk can go unnoticed.Behavioral bias and spending psychologyBy lowering the “pain of paying,” BNPL encourages larger and more frequent purchases. This can inflate exposure at the portfolio level. Particularly in categories like fashion, beauty, and electronics. These are expected to generate a 72.5% share of BNPL usage in 2025 due to high repeat demand.‍BNPL fraud risksBNPL’s instant-approval model makes it an attractive target for fraud. Effective BNPL fraud prevention is becoming critical as fraud tactics evolve.Dynamic fraud, static defensesTraditional fraud defenses don’t work in a high-velocity BNPL environment. Static KYC checks and manual reviews are valuable techniques, but they aren’t real-time. Fraudsters exploit every millisecond of latency between onboarding and loan approval. As BNPL adoption grows, attackers increasingly use automation and AI-driven bots. They also conduct large-scale testing to bypass outdated security layers. Without continuous, real-time monitoring, platforms face higher approval of fraudulent transactions. This leads to mounting operational losses.Synthetic identities and account takeoversBNPL platforms face rising exposure to synthetic identity fraud, where real and fake data are combined to create “legitimate” profiles that pass onboarding. Similarly, account takeover attacks leverage phishing and credential ...",

It is expected to reach $4.58 billion in revenue by 2030, growing at a 10.1% CAGR.Explore a silent process that fills in the gaps and helps lenders say “yes” or “no” faster and more confidently – data enrichment.‍What is data enrichment through a credit lens?Data enrichment in credit means adding alternative information to traditional credit data. There are many different types of alternative data in lending, such as digital behavior, utility payments, transaction histories, and social profiles.By showing the full picture, data enrichment helps lenders serve people who are invisible to traditional models. Also, this extra layer of insight allows them to spot more hidden risks. ‍4 ways B2B data enrichment solutions​ power credit risk modelsPartnering with alternative data providers is key to a more transparent view of every applicant. Here are just a few ways this kind of data strengthens risk models.1. Filling the gapsWhen traditional checks fall short for no-file or thin-file applicants, enriched digital signals step in. They reveal patterns of stability and intent that help lenders see a clearer credit picture.2. Spotting red flags earlyData enrichment flags suspicious combinations, such as a brand-new email, a proxy IP, or a disposable phone number. These often point to synthetic fraud. This early warning gives lenders a chance to filter out risky applications. 3. Speeding up approvalsApplicants who show strong digital trust signals can move through the process faster. Enrichment helps lenders separate these low-risk profiles so they can reduce manual reviews.4. Refining the scoreExtra data deepens your scoring models and paints a fuller picture of each applicant. It allows lenders to expand their services to reach unbanked and underbanked segments.‍Case study. Clicredito MX scores “invisibles” with data enrichmentCan a data enrichment solution fuel a lender's growth? Yes, and Clicredito MX proved it by leveraging alternative data to scale up its approvals.What happened?Clicredito MX is a Mexican fintech company built to give consumers rapid access to capital. They offer a fully digital application and can disburse funds within minutes. Due to this speed and convenience, the number of applicants grew rapidly.What went wrong?With many applicants new to credit, Clicredito MX found it hard to assess them using traditional data alone. Thin files and lack of credit histories kept approvals low, putting a ceiling on growth.How the challenge was tackledThat’s when they partnered with RiskSeal to look beyond credit reports. RiskSeal pulled in alternative financial stability signals from digital footprints analysis. That way, Clicredito MX became able to evaluate applicants’ real financial discipline.The resultBy adding RiskSeal’s alternative data to traditional scoring, Clicredito MX made much better credit decisions. They approved more applicants with little or no credit history and caught fraud faster. All without taking on extra risk.The takeawayData enrichment helped Clicredito MX grow by making invisible customers scorable. By using new insights into applicant behavior, they approved more loans, lowered defaults, and became a more trusted lender.\n  \n    Enrich your credit model\n  \n  \n  to expand approvals safely\n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n       Book a Demo\n       \n       Book a Demo\n      \n     \n    \n  \n‍Alternative data sources to enrich your credit modelHere are some of the most valuable and proven data sources for enriching your credit models.RiskSeal uses over 400 data points behind the scenes.

How does it work? How can it be made as effective as possible in today's realities? Read more about this and beyond in our article.‍What is customer risk scoring​?Risk scoring in lending refers to the process of credit risk assessment by assigning a numerical score that reflects the likelihood of default or fraud by a potential borrower, helping lenders avoid issuing high risk loans.Traditional scoring models use financial information from credit bureaus for this purpose. This includes the length of credit history, types of loans taken, payment timeliness, and other similar data.However, in recent years, more and more lenders have pointed out the shortcomings of this practice.First, there are many consumers without a credit history — the so-called unbanked individuals. In some developing regions, they make up nearly half of the working-age population:Secondly, traditional financial information is easy to falsify, which fraudsters successfully take advantage of.According to a recent financial fraud report, 35% of banks and fintech companies encountered 1,000+ fraud attempts over the past year. Moreover, 1 in 10 respondents reported 10,000+ cases of criminal activity:In this regard, the modern risk scoring methodology involves the use of alternative data. This refers to information about borrowers that is not related to their banking activity.Such data may include details of any regular payments (utility bills or rent payments), information about mobile phone usage, and more. However, the most informative source of such data is considered to be consumers’ digital footprints — all the information that remains publicly accessible on the internet as a result of users' online activity.\n  \n    Assess unbanked customers\n  \n  \n  with alternative data insights\n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n       Book a Demo\n       \n       Book a Demo\n      \n     \n    \n  \n‍How risk scoring works: step-by-step processThe process of identifying high-risk borrowers in modern lending organizations occurs in several stages.Stage #1. Data collection This stage involves gathering hundreds of data points from alternative sources. These will later be used for a comprehensive digital footprint analysis. Such data includes:Email data. By analyzing an applicant's email address, a lender can estimate its age, track online accounts registered with it, and detect any data breaches or spam-related activity.Phone number data. This includes information about the mobile operator and the type of number (allowing the identification of temporary numbers, burner phones, or virtual SIM cards). It also enables tracking of the borrower's location via the carrier code and checking whether the number appears in high-risk databases.IP address data. Analyzing an IP address helps determine a person's real geolocation and detect attempts to mask it. This can be indicated by the use of anonymizing tools such as VPNs, TOR, and similar services.Browsing behavior data. This includes information about the applicant's online activity, such as visited websites, online registrations, purchases on e-commerce platforms, and social media account activity.Stage #2. Data enrichmentAt this stage, the collected alternative data is integrated into the existing risk scoring model.A modern data enrichment solution can optimize the credit scoring process by combining information from external fraud databases with data from non-traditional sources.It has been proven that this approach delivers maximum efficiency:The graph shows that combining traditional and alternative credit data allows for the most objective assessment of applicants.Stage #3. Behavioral analysisAdvanced scoring systems are based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These technologies make it possible to track patterns in user behavior and detect anomalies.This practice is known as behavioral analysis. Recent studies show that the accuracy of fraud detection using this method can reach 80%.In addition to high accuracy, this approach has another significant advantage.

In this article, we take an in-depth look at the challenges and emerging risks they face every day.‍Customer risks in the BNPL business modelBNPL’s success is built on speed, simplicity, and frictionless user experience. But those same strengths introduce new credit risk vulnerabilities.Affordability vs. impulsivityBreaking payments into small installments can make it hard to tell if a customer is borrowing responsibly or taking on too much.‍Many BNPL users rely on the service to access credit quickly.

In fact, 76% of those who missed a BNPL payment had experienced one or more major life events in the past year.Impulse purchases are also common during seasonal sales. This is when ads and marketing promotions encourage quick spending. BNPL providers must manage risk while keeping onboarding and approval processes fast. Even at a huge sales-driven scale.Thin-file borrowersBNPL attracts many credit-invisible consumers. Some of these consumers may be financially responsible, but for most, their credit behavior is unknown. These include:Renters with no mortgage recordSavers who avoid credit cardsFreelancers without salaried incomeExcluding such applicants can lead to missed growth opportunities. But approving them blindly creates elevated risk. Credit providers must therefore enrich bureau scores with alternative digital signals in BNPL to solve the credit invisibility issue.Repayment behavior complexitySome BNPL defaults aren’t caused by financial hardship but by behavioral deprioritization. Because BNPL is perceived as low-stakes, certain customers treat repayments as optional. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine distress from opportunistic default.Payment stacking and hidden leverageA growing challenge is BNPL stacking. This happens when consumers take out loans across multiple BNPL providers at once.Nearly 60% of young users (18-28) have between two and five BNPL plans simultaneously. Often without fully realizing their cumulative obligations.Traditional credit bureaus don’t yet fully capture BNPL exposures, leaving lenders blind to aggregate risk. Providers are increasingly sharing data with each other to spot hidden debt quickly.Income volatilityBNPL adoption is especially high among people whose income streams fluctuate significantly.Their risk profiles are dynamic month to month. This requires continuous monitoring rather than static underwriting at loan origination.In today’s economy, many people juggle multiple gigs, side hustles, and alternative income sources. Credit bureaus often cannot track this.Without leveraging behavioral data in lending to closely monitor a person’s financial behavior and spending habits, risk can go unnoticed.Behavioral bias and spending psychologyBy lowering the “pain of paying,” BNPL encourages larger and more frequent purchases. This can inflate exposure at the portfolio level. Particularly in categories like fashion, beauty, and electronics.

Among other benefits are: Minimal borrower requirementsZero interest on the loanInstant decision-making on applicationsFast deal-closing processFor consumers, services like Klarna, Afterpay, or Affirm seem like the perfect solution. But what about the providers themselves? On the one hand, offering BNPL services allows BNPL to earn commissions from retailers and expand its customer base.On the other hand, they face significant risks. The default rate for such deals remains extremely high.Let’s talk about how to solve the problems of risk assessment for BNPL.‍The rise and risks of BNPLAccording to recent research, the global market volume for Buy Now, Pay Later services is measured in billions of dollars. It is expected that by the end of 2025, the amount of BNPL payments will exceed $560 billion.This is not the limit of the industry's growth. In the next five years, it is projected to show a CAGR of 10.2% and reach $911 billion by 2030.‍‍As for the geography of BNPL service adoption, the current leaders in terms of implementation are Sweden, Germany, and Norway:‍Experts are confident that shortly, their popularity will grow in developing markets as well. For example, in Africa and Southeast Asia, BNPL platforms serve as tools to improve financial inclusivity.Such rapid industry development brings about a significant problem. Along with the growth in the popularity of BNPL platforms, the level of financial losses for lenders also increases. The cause of these losses is overdue payments on transactions and an increase in the number of fraudulent applications.Research by the Australian company RFI Global shows that 15% of borrowers default on Buy Now, Pay Later transactions. For consumers with low credit scores, this figure rises to 22%.Fraud is another problem faced by lenders. Experts say fraudsters often target these platforms because their credit checks are less stringent than those of major financial institutions.‍BNPL fraud types RiskSeal can eliminateThere are many types of fraud associated with lending on BNPL platforms. That’s why BNPL fraud prevention solutions like RiskSeal play a critical role, eliminating high-risk applications before approval.Synthetic identitiesThis type of fraud involves the creation of a fake identity using a combination of real and fabricated data.Criminals may use a combination of names, birthdates, and social security numbers of different individuals and supplement this information with a fictitious address and a one-time phone number.An application for a loan is submitted on behalf of this non-existent borrower. Naturally, with no intention of repaying it.This is one of the most prevalent types of fraud. Experian data confirms this, with the company's report showing a 60% increase in such cases in 2024 compared to the previous year.New account abuseThe essence of this scheme is as follows. Fraudsters open new fake accounts and use them to quickly complete transactions on BNPL services to never repay the debt.The scale of the problem is confirmed by the fact that in 2024, nearly 29% of solutions in the fraud prevention market for BNPL were focused specifically on combating this type of crime.First-party (intentional default) fraudThis type of fraud involves the intentional non-payment of a loan by the borrower. A person applies for a product purchase through a Buy Now, Pay Later platform, already knowing that they will not repay the debt.The main difference is that this fraudulent scheme is intentional, while an unintentional default usually happens because of financial problems or unexpected events.Identity theftThis type of fraud involves the theft of personal data for unauthorized use, such as completing Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) transactions without the rightful owner’s consent.It remains one of the most common forms of financial crime. In the United States, it ranks second in popularity among criminals, second only to credit card fraud. 34% of the country's population suffers from it:‍‍Potentially, the data of each victim (about 115 million people in the United States) could be used to obtain fraudulent loans on BNPL platforms.Promo abuse tied to identity duplicationBNPL service providers often resort to various promotional campaigns to attract new ...",

A mid-sized lender boosted approvals with consumer behaviour data​Benefits of using behavioral dataCredit behaviour​ analysis with RiskSealBehavioral insights are becoming essential for credit risk assessment, driving demand for analytics solutions. This demand is fueling behavior analytics market growth from $1.1 billion in 2024 to $10.8 billion by 2032.In this article, we explore how behavioral data works in lending and the key patterns that help lenders assess real-world credit risk.‍Behavioural data examples​ in digital lendingModern credit decisions depend on more than just numbers from a credit bureau. Behavioral data has become essential in understanding real-world risk. Especially in markets with thin files or first-time borrowers.In lending, behavioral data means the digital and financial habits of applicants. These are shown through online activity, device use, and transactions.These patterns help lenders look past basic checks to judge a borrower’s intent, consistency, and reliability. Let’s look at three key categories that play a role.#1. Transaction behavior, or how borrowers spend and earnSpending behavior is a window into a person’s priorities and financial habits. Lenders can see how borrowers manage their money by reviewing bank transactions, digital wallet use, or open banking data.Are they spending mostly on rent, groceries, and transportation? Or is there heavy discretionary spending on luxury goods or gambling apps?Recurring payments are another powerful signal. Regular payments for utilities, phone plans, and streaming subscriptions suggest a disciplined approach. These aren’t flashy metrics. But they reveal a borrower’s ability to stay on top of recurring responsibilities.Income deposits round out the picture. A steady stream of income, even if from freelance or gig work, indicates financial predictability. Paired with consistent cash flow, it builds trust in the borrower’s ability to manage repayment.More advanced platforms apply Transaction Risk Analysis (TRA) on top of this data. This involves:Anomaly detection to flag irregular patterns (e.g., sudden spikes in spending or multiple failed payments).Predictive insights that anticipate financial stress based on subtle shifts in transaction behavior.Used carefully, these patterns help lenders make decisions that are both faster and fairer.#2. Device and usage behavior, or how borrowers applyThe device a borrower uses during onboarding can reveal more than just their tech preference. Mobile logins from the same device and location over time suggest consistent usage patterns. In contrast, applying under multiple identities or from suspicious IPs can flag suspicious or bot activity.Behavioral fingerprinting also plays a role. It analyzes technical markers, like operating system, screen resolution, or browser configuration. This helps detect inconsistencies and unusual patterns.Lenders often look for:Device type. Smartphone vs. desktop, and whether it’s personal or shared.App usage. Frequency of logins, duration of sessions, timing (e.g., middle of the night).Geolocation signals. IP and GPS consistency with the declared address.Behavioral red flags. Autofill usage, speed of form completion, or simultaneous logins from different geographies.These signals create a digital context for each applicant. It’s useful for both fraud prevention and trust-building.#3. Communication behaviour insights​, or how borrowers respondHow a borrower communicates before and after applying can also signal reliability. It’s not about reading messages or personal content. It’s about observing patterns of engagement and responsiveness.Applicants who reply to emails quickly or open notifications often are more engaged. Those who ignore outreach entirely tend to be less responsive.Customer support behavior also highlights how borrowers handle pressure or resolve issues.Here are some common behavioral markers lenders use:Responsiveness – reaction time to emails, texts, or in-app prompts.Engagement level – open rates, click-throughs, message acknowledgment.Support interactions – frequency of contact, tone of communication, issue resolution history.Sentiment signals – in AI-assisted setups, patterns in language can flag frustration, urgency, or evasion.In context, these signals help tell apart genuinely delayed borrowers from those avoiding repayment. This distinction lets lenders respond with the right strategy.‍Behavioral data use cases in credit risk decisionsA...",

It lets consumers split purchases into instant, interest-free installments.According to Investopedia, the global BNPL market reached over $179 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $3.7 trillion by 2030. This rapid growth creates new challenges for assessing credit risk, especially since many users don’t have traditional credit histories. That’s where alternative credit scoring for BNPL providers becomes important.‍‍Top 5 credit risk challenges in BNPLAccording to Coin Law statistics for 2024, 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked. It’s an enormous growth market for BNPL, especially in developing regions.Key risks to consider:#1. Limited credit historyMany BNPL users are new to credit or have thin files. Since most BNPL loans aren’t reported to credit bureaus, lenders can’t see a customer’s full debt picture.#2. Frequent, short-term loansBNPL loans are small and repaid quickly, but users often take out several at once. This increases the never-pay risk.#3. Loan stackingWithout shared data between providers, users can stack loans across platforms. To reduce this “invisible” debt risk, BNPL companies increasingly rely on alternative credit scoring. It includes various checks from email age to a reverse phone number search engine to verify borrower reliability.#4. Impulse spendingFast, easy approvals encourage overspending. Many users misjudge what they can afford, leading to higher default rates.#5. Economic sensitivityBNPL users are often more vulnerable in tough times. During downturns, missed payments can spike due to short repayment cycles.‍How BNPL uses alternative credit scoringAlternative credit scoring is a way to assess someone's creditworthiness using non-traditional data.Unlike traditional credit scoring, which looks mainly at credit history, repayment records, and defaults, alternative credit scoring for BNPL providers also includes data like:Digital footprintsSpending behaviorSocial media activity‍Email data‍Mobile phone usage‍Location insightsThis broader approach, often called digital credit scoring, helps BNPL providers evaluate people who may not have a formal credit history.BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) providers can create detailed customer profiles by combining different sources of information. This helps them check a customer’s creditworthiness and understand how reliable they might be financially.\n  \n    Power your BNPL decisions\n  \n  \n  with digital footprint analysis\n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n       Book a Demo\n       \n       Book a Demo\n      \n     \n    \n  \n‍10 strategic advantages for BNPL credit risk managers1. Improved risk differentiationAlternative data gives a clearer picture of each applicant, helping lenders spot reliable borrowers even in groups that usually seem risky. It helps tell apart people who are likely to repay from those who aren’t.2. Lower default rates over timeLooking at how people spend and behave financially helps models better guess who will pay back loans. This means more good approvals, fewer missed payments, and stronger BNPL fraud prevention through early detection of high-risk users.3. Staying ahead of regulationsAs rules around BNPL get tighter, providers need to show clearly how credit risk decisions are made, especially when using AI. This helps them stay compliant and ahead of the curve.4. Operational efficiency at scaleUsing machine learning to run credit checks means fewer people are needed to do manual reviews, so companies can grow faster without hiring more staff or increasing costs.5. Better customer retention & loyaltyBy offering fair access to credit, especially for financially underserved consumers, BNPL providers can build trust and long-term loyalty, leading to increased lifetime value.6. Instant credit decisionsReal-time decisions powered by AI and alternative data help lenders approve or reject applications instantly. These models quickly scan a wide range of data points to make smart, accurate calls.7. Geographic & demographic expansionAlternative credit scoring makes it easier to assess risk in emerging markets or younger populations, where traditional credit bureaus have limited coverage.8. Competitive differentiationFaster, smarter, and more inclusive credit decision-making becomes a brand differentiator, particularly in a crowded BNPL market.9. Faster product iterationBetter data about how users act and repay loans makes it easier to quickly test new loan offers, repayment plans, or special deals.10.

Instead, they connect directly with investors on P2P lending websites. For quick cash loans, unsecured personal loans, and even business funding solutions. Lenders, on the other hand, enjoy higher returns on their cash savings.The global P2P lending market is growing fast and is projected to reach over US$ 919.73 billion by 2032 with a registered CAGR of 26.50% from 2023 to 2032. By 2050 its value is expected to be around one trillion US$. There is a clear need for more straightforward, inclusive, and equalizing financial services.Sharing economy has proved a game-changer in many industries. But this time it’s the lenders, not the banks, who bear the major risk of loan defaults. So the next-gen money lending platforms better be risk-free! Power of dataTraditional banks bar the borrowers with no credit history or scarce financial information. That hurts the most vulnerable - migrants, people with special needs, and other good-willed individuals. At the same time, bad players would often game a system that is unable to detect fraudulent patterns.This divide shows how outdated the processes of brick-and-mortar lending are. In the meantime, alternative data sources are available to ensure better inclusiveness and lower entry risk. Digital footprint analysis is a complex method used to assess creditworthiness.So what exactly is digital footprint? The Internet keeps memory of all our activities: accounts we create, sites we visit, files we share, interactions we have, devices we use. It creates a unique pattern of our preferences, behavior, and even financial situation. The traces we leave over time form our digital universe that holds the insights of who we are.\n  \n    Detect fraud before it happens\n  \n  \n  with digital footprinting\n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n       Book a Demo\n       \n       Book a Demo\n      \n     \n    \n  \nDigital footprint varies.An active digital footprint is the content we create - posts, comments, reviews or forum discussions. A passive digital footprint is all the other activities, like the sites we visit and pages we browse. Digital footprint analysis - or digital footprinting - can reveal our behavior, traits, inclinations and much more. Digital footprinting is valuable for background checks. Unlike the data filled in the physical form, our digital footprint cannot be falsified. Moreover, in the world of online-first, it tells more about a person than face-to-face communication with someone we don’t know. Bottom line, it tells a legit person from synthetic identity.Digital footprint analysis works with various data points - an email address, phone number, or social media handle. It analyzes their occurrence online. Email & phone number. Check them against a long list of online platforms and social media sites to verify the connection. See if the email or phone number have been blacklisted, reported or involved in data breaches. Age is also important as fraudsters tend to use disposable numbers or create single-use emails.

It lets consumers split purchases into instant, interest-free installments.According to Investopedia, the global BNPL market reached over $179 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $3.7 trillion by 2030. This rapid growth creates new challenges for assessing credit risk, especially since many users don’t have traditional credit histories. That’s where alternative credit scoring for BNPL providers becomes important.‍‍Top 5 credit risk challenges in BNPLAccording to Coin Law statistics for 2024, 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked. It’s an enormous growth market for BNPL, especially in developing regions.Key risks to consider:#1. Limited credit historyMany BNPL users are new to credit or have thin files. Since most BNPL loans aren’t reported to credit bureaus, lenders can’t see a customer’s full debt picture.#2. Frequent, short-term loansBNPL loans are small and repaid quickly, but users often take out several at once. This increases the never-pay risk.#3. Loan stackingWithout shared data between providers, users can stack loans across platforms. To reduce this “invisible” debt risk, BNPL companies increasingly rely on alternative credit scoring. It includes various checks from email age to a reverse phone number search engine to verify borrower reliability.#4. Impulse spendingFast, easy approvals encourage overspending. Many users misjudge what they can afford, leading to higher default rates.#5. Economic sensitivityBNPL users are often more vulnerable in tough times. During downturns, missed payments can spike due to short repayment cycles.‍How BNPL uses alternative credit scoringAlternative credit scoring is a way to assess someone's creditworthiness using non-traditional data.Unlike traditional credit scoring, which looks mainly at credit history, repayment records, and defaults, alternative credit scoring for BNPL providers also includes data like:Digital footprintsSpending behaviorSocial media activity‍Email data‍Mobile phone usage‍Location insightsThis broader approach, often called digital credit scoring, helps BNPL providers evaluate people who may not have a formal credit history.BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) providers can create detailed customer profiles by combining different sources of information. This helps them check a customer’s creditworthiness and understand how reliable they might be financially.\n  \n    Power your BNPL decisions\n  \n  \n  with digital footprint analysis\n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n       Book a Demo\n       \n       Book a Demo\n      \n     \n    \n  \n‍10 strategic advantages for BNPL credit risk managers1.

With our experience in solvency assessment, we’d like to share risk management insights to help your BNPL business succeed.‍Overview of BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later)Since 2019, the global BNPL market has expanded tenfold, surging from $34 billion to $349 billion. Furthermore, forecasts predict it will reach $834 billion by 2028.This trend is driven by the growing demand for the Buy Now, Pay Later service. According to recent industry research, 29% of online shoppers use this service at least once a month. An additional 47% of respondents stated that they pay for half or more of their purchases using BNPL. Another impressive forecast comes from Adobe Analytics experts, who predict that during this year's holiday season, Americans will spend on BNPL purchases a record $18.5 billion.The growing popularity of installments is leading to an increase in overdue payments on BNPL transactions. A recent survey conducted for Bloomberg revealed that 43% of Buy Now, Pay Later customers have overdue payments.In most cases, the emergence of problematic debt is due to a lack of funds or simple forgetfulness. However, there are also fraudsters among BNPL clients. According to FICO data, 23% of synthetic identity fraud cases occur within the BNPL sector.A responsible approach to credit decisioning plays a crucial role in reducing default rates and ensuring effective BNPL fraud prevention for such companies.‍‍Key credit scoring challenges for BNPL providersThe specifics of the industry lead to certain challenges for BNPL providers in credit scoring.Here are the main ones.Fast approvals with minimal dataTo meet user expectations, Buy Now, Pay Later providers must offer instant decision-making for transactions. This doesn't allow for a thorough examination of the applicant.Additionally, a minimal set of data is required from the potential borrower. As a result, it can be difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of their creditworthiness.High risk of never-paysAccording to eMarketer, most BNPL customers are from Gen Z, meaning they are young people under the age of 27.They often lack sufficient credit history to make an informed decision on the application.Providers operating in developing markets also face significant challenges. This is because there is a low level of banking service coverage.In some of developing countries, over 60% of the population remains unbanked or underbanked:Balancing user experience and risk managementFinding the balance between a smooth approval process and effective BNPL risk management is crucial for such companies.Here’s why this is so important.1. Simplicity and speed are among the main advantages of Buy Now, Pay Later services.Customers expect instant decisions without long processing times or the need to submit large amounts of documentation.If this expectation is not met, the customer may choose an alternative payment model.2. While ensuring a smooth approval process is important, providers must not neglect BNPL credit risk management. This is necessary to reduce default rates and the likelihood of fraud.‍Essential credit scoring features for BNPL providersTo meet user demands and avoid significant losses, BNPL providers should adopt a unique approach to credit scoring.This approach includes using alternative data, behavioral insights, and innovative technologies to assess consumers.Alternative data through digital footprint analysisTurning to a progressive scoring platform, such as RiskSeal, allows using digital footprint analysis for BNPL. This helps assess the applicant’s creditworthiness and detect early signs of fraud.Digital footprints are a valuable alternative data source, providing access to types of alternative data such as:1. Information from email lookup. By knowing the applicant's email, you can gather:Email activity and validityAge of the email addressPresence of linked online accountsDomain informationData breach incidentsInclusion in blacklists2. Phone number lookup data. A phone number can reveal a lot about its owner, such as:Use of suspicious numbers (temporary phones or virtual SIM cards)Discrepancies between the IP address and operator codePresence in blacklists or high-risk databases3. Borrower location data. Alternative data can also come from IP address lookup, which reveals:Location at the time of ...",

It reflects our commitment to taking every possible measure to safeguard sensitive information and handle it with the care it deserves.Credit decisioning relies on sensitive data, from borrower profiles to alternative signals. That’s why, whether you’re a lender, fintech, or even a loan applicant, you can count on us to protect every piece of data you share.‍What is ISO/IEC 27001:2022?ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is the leading international standard for information security management systems (ISMS).It helps organizations keep sensitive data safe. This includes protecting against unauthorized access, leaks, and cyberattacks.To get certified, a company must follow strict rules across 14 key domains:Access controlCryptographyPhysical and environmental securityCommunications securityOperations managementSystem acquisition, development, and maintenanceInformation security incident managementBusiness continuityComplianceRisk assessment and treatmentHuman resource securityAsset managementSupplier relationshipsSecurity policies and organizationEach domain helps ensure the right controls are in place to protect data.‍Why do companies pursue this certificationIn fields like digital credit scoring and alternative data, where sensitive information is central, strong security practices are essential. Especially when those insights support credit decisions across fintech and lending.Companies invest the time and effort in achieving this certification because it:Proves compliance with global security standards.Builds trust with clients and partners.Reduces risk of data breaches and strengthens internal controls.Supports legal and regulatory compliance, especially in financial services.Earning ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is more than just passing an audit. It requires an independent, accredited body to review and confirm that a company meets the strict standards.‍Why ISO/IEC 27001:2022 matters in 2025-2026Data breaches are rising fast. In 2024 alone, over 1.35 billion people were impacted by data breaches, according to Statista’s research on U.S. data compromises. Many of these breaches happened in financial services.With regulators, clients, and end users watching closely, security is no longer a \"nice to have\". It’s required.At RiskSeal, we handle large volumes of sensitive credit data. That’s why we pursued ISO/IEC 27001:2022: protecting that data is core to maintaining the trust our clients place in us.‍The process behind getting certifiedGetting ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certified isn’t quick. It took us over 8 months of preparation, collaboration, and careful reviews.The process included a multi-stage audit.

Even among borrowers with little to no credit history.This is exclusive RiskSeal’s research. It offers a data-driven look at how alternative data is reshaping credit risk assessment.‍The context: why Mexico is the perfect test caseMexico’s consumer lending market is growing fast. It reached $323.4 billion in 2024 and is expected to hit $532.7 billion by 2033.The country is also a fintech powerhouse. More than 1,100 fintech companies now operate in Mexico, growing about 4% a year.Their revenues are up 31% year over year, and about 60% focus on underserved consumers with little or no credit history.This mix makes Mexico the perfect place to test how digital data can fill credit gaps. Here, bureau records are often thin or outdated, leaving lenders with an incomplete picture of risk.‍Goal of the researchRiskSeal set out to answer one key question: can digital credit scores reliably predict real-world defaults?To explore this, we partnered with seven lending institutions: three microfinance companies, three BNPL providers, and one neobank. Together, we scored 6.1 million loan applications.The goal was to confirm that digital credit scores aren’t just theoretical but reliably predict real-world defaults.This research was designed to test digital scoring in real lending environments and show how behavioral and device-level data can give lenders a clearer, fairer way to assess risk.‍Target audienceThis research is for credit risk managers, credit providers, and financial institutions. Especially those looking for better ways to assess borrowers when traditional data is scarce.It shows how digital signals can strengthen underwriting models, improve portfolio performance, and expand access to credit for underserved consumers.All results are aggregated and anonymized. No client-specific or personal data is shared.‍What the RiskSeal Digital Credit Score is and what it measuresThe RiskSeal Digital Credit Score is a country-specific, proprietary model built on insights from over 100 million loan applications.It’s a real-time risk signal designed to predict repayment behavior at the exact moment of application.The model evaluates both the number and quality of online services an applicant uses, turning everyday digital activity into a measurable indicator of creditworthiness.Each applicant receives a score from 0 to 999, with higher numbers signaling lower expected risk.\n  \n    \n      Score range\n      Category\n      Interpretation\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0–299\n      Very high risk\n      Frequent red flags and mismatched signals\n    \n    \n      300–499\n      Threshold\n      Elevated risk, requires additional checks\n    \n    \n      500–699\n      Moderate\n      Acceptable risk with some caution\n    \n    \n      700–799\n      Strong\n      Solid applicant profile\n    \n    \n      800–899\n      Excellent\n      Highly reliable digital footprint\n    \n    \n      900–999\n      Outstanding\n      Exceptional trust and stability\n    \n  \n‍These ranges help lenders tailor their workflows, tightening controls for the low end and fast-tracking strong applicants.‍How RiskSeal score is builtThe digital credit scoring model combines over 400 digital signals across key identity dimensions:Email: domain quality, account age, breach exposurePhone: carrier type, SIM stability, VoIP indicatorsIP & device: proxy, VPN, or TOR usage; device reputationLocation & timezone: alignment between declared and observed patternsSubscriptions & eCommerce activity: presence across verified digital servicesWeb registrations & social footprint: signals of consistency and authenticityBreach & fraud markers: traces of compromised or synthetic identitiesEach factor contributes to the score – negative signals lower it, stable ones lift it.RiskSeal’s model is fully transparent. All inputs are available via API, so lenders can audit and review the logic behind every score.‍Research methodologyThe analysis was based on a combined dataset of 6,101,483 consumer loan applications collected from seven lenders.Each application was scored at the time of submission, using only information available before approval. No post-approval information was used.Defaults were reported directly by partner institutions and harmonized into a single definition.Default rates were then calculated per band and checked for a monotonic trend. This was done to check if that risk consistently declined as scores rose.\n  \n    See digital scoring\n  \n  \n  in action\n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n       Book a Demo\n       \n       Book a Demo\n      \n     \n    \n  \n‍How we analyzed the dataSorted the scores into bands.We grouped applicants into simple 100-point ranges (0–99, 100–199, … up to 900–999). This step makes the results easy to read and compare.Saw where applicants land.For each band, we measured how many people actually fell into that range. This shows the distribution of the portfolio across the score spectrum.Checked the default rate.Within each band, we calculated what percentage of applicants defaulted. This is the clearest way to link digital score levels with real repayment behavior.Confirmed the trend.We tested whether default rates kept dropping as scores went up – a monotonic decline. This ensures the pattern isn’t just random noise.Summarized the results. Finally, we pulled everything together into high-level metrics that lenders can compare to their own books.‍Applicant distribution: where borrowers sit on the spectrumBefore looking at performance, it’s important to see how applicants are spread across the score range. This shows how much each part of the scoring spectrum influences the overall portfolio.When analyzing more than six million applications, we found that borrowers are not evenly spread. Some score ranges are far more crowded than others.‍Borrower score distributionBefore evaluating score performance, it’s useful to look at how applicants are spread across the scoring range.The distribution reveals three broad borrower segments. Understanding these groups helps lenders interpret score patterns and make more precise credit decisions.The table below shows the share of applicants in each 100-point band.\n  \n    \n      Score range\n      Share of applicants\n      Number of applicants\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0–99\n      3%\n      183,044\n    \n    \n      100–199\n      5.5%\n      335,581\n    \n    \n      200–299\n      9.7%\n      591,844\n    \n    \n      300–399\n      15%\n      915,223\n    \n    \n      400–499\n      19%\n      1,159,282\n    \n    \n      500–599\n      23.3%\n      1,421,646\n    \n    \n      600–699\n      14.5%\n      884,715\n    \n    \n      700–799\n      5.8%\n      353,886\n    \n    \n      800–899\n      2.7%\n      164,740\n    \n    \n      900–999\n      1.5%\n      91,522\n    \n  \n‍The distribution highlights three broad borrower segments:Low scores (0–299): 18.2% of all applicantsBorrowers in this range often show weak or inconsistent digital footprints – disposable emails, VoIP numbers, or frequent IP and device changes.They represent the riskiest segment, where defaults are most likely.Mid scores (300–599): 57.3% of all applicantsThis is the largest group in the dataset. These borrowers aren’t necessarily high-risk, but many are still stabilizing their financial behavior or recovering from prior credit challenges.Their digital footprints show partial stability, like regular online activity, active telecom services, etc. But they do not yet have the long-term consistency seen in higher scorers.High scores (600–999): 24.5% of all applicantsA smaller but clearly distinct segment. These applicants show cohesive, well-established digital identities.Signals showing this include consistent devices, long-lived email accounts, and engagement with major online services. Their repayment performance is strong, and defaults are rare.In summary, most borrowers fall in the mid-range, where lenders face the toughest calls.The digital score helps pinpoint who is steadily improving versus who may be drifting toward default risk.‍Key finding: higher digital scores mean fewer defaultsTo evaluate whether RiskSeal’s digital scores truly correlate with repayment behavior, we calculated the default rate within each score band.In this analysis, “default” is defined as a payment delay of 90 days or more past due, based on standardized reporting across all partner lenders.Shorter delays (a missed payment within 30 or 60 days) are treated as delinquencies, not defaults. Our goal was to isolate the most serious and financially relevant credit events.This approach ensures a consistent, like-for-like comparison across millions of loan records, regardless of product type or lender policy.The table below summarizes how default rates change as digital scores increase:\n  \n    \n      Score band\n      Defaulters\n      Good borrowers\n      Default rate\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0–99\n      95,182\n      87,862\n      52%\n    \n    \n      100–199\n      127,520\n      208,061\n      38%\n    \n    \n      200–299\n      177,553\n      414,291\n      30%\n    \n    \n      300–399\n      219,653\n      695,570\n      24%\n    \n    \n      400–499\n      220,263\n      939,019\n      19%\n    \n    \n      500–599\n      199,030\n      1,222,616\n      14%\n    \n    \n      600–699\n      88,471\n      796,244\n      10%\n    \n    \n      700–799\n      28,310\n      325,576\n      8%\n    \n    \n      800–899\n      9,884\n      154,856\n      6%\n    \n    \n      900–999\n      4,576\n      86,946\n      5%\n    \n  \n‍The data reveal a clear, monotonic decline in default rates as digital scores increase.Those in the middle range show gradual improvement. Top scorers – individuals with cohesive, long-standing digital identities – default in fewer than one in ten cases.This consistency across millions of applications demonstrates the score’s predictive strength and practical reliability for lenders.‍Patterns behind the signalsThe clear link between digital scores and default rates reflects deeper behavioral and technical patterns.Borrowers at the bottom of the spectrum tend to show fragmented or unstable digital markers:Identity and communication: disposable or recently created email addresses, frequent domain changes, VoIP numbers, and inconsistent personal data across applications.Tech and network habits: constantly shifting IPs, VPN or TOR usage, multiple devices tied to one identity, and timezone mismatches across sessions.Behavioral activity: frequent failed verifications, limited or erratic eCommerce activity, missing subscriptions, and repeated applications across lenders within short periods.Security and risk exposure: indicators linked to chargebacks or fraud, breach-exposed credentials with no recovery activity, and a lack of stable online registrations.Each of these signals may seem minor on its own. But together, they form a clear pattern of instability and a higher likelihood of default.At the other end of the spectrum, high digital scorers show stable, consistent patterns across their online and device data.Their profiles reflect reliability, long-term activity, and low-risk digital behavior:Verified identities: long-standing email accounts, stable domains, and consistent personal details across applications.Predictable digital habits: steady device and IP usage, minimal use of masking tools, and regular login patterns.Engaged online presence: active telecom and subscription services, regular eCommerce activity, and complete, accurate applications.Trusted reputation signals: no ties to fraud or chargebacks, secure credentials, and well-established online profiles.Together, these traits paint a picture of digital maturity and stability.Borrowers who maintain these patterns demonstrate stronger repayment behavior. And their high digital credit scores reflect that trustworthiness.‍Operational implications for lendersThe digital score’s value lies in its ability to turn risk insights into actionable lending decisions.Instead of applying one policy to all borrowers, lenders can use score bands to tailor workflows, improve risk control, and enhance the customer experience.In practice, this means:Enhanced KYC or manual review for applicants in the 300-499 range to reduce exposure to fraud and borderline-risk cases.Fast-tracked approvals for applicants with scores above 800 to speed up onboarding and improve the experience for low-risk borrowers.Ongoing monitoring or tighter credit limits for applicants in the mid-bands to manage evolving risk and maintain a healthy portfolio.This band-specific approach helps lenders balance growth with risk control, improving both efficiency and performance.‍Model performance and complementarity with credit bureau dataTo measure predictive strength, the final RiskSeal digital scoring model was tested on an independent dataset.The model achieved an AUC of 0.67, showing stable predictive power in identifying default risk across different lending portfolios.Even on its own – without traditional credit data – the digital score can reliably separate higher-risk borrowers from lower-risk ones.When combined with credit bureau information, the model performs even better.This comparison shows that behavioral and digital footprint data complement traditional credit signals rather than compete with them.\n  \n    \n      Model type\n      AUC (predictive accuracy)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Digital-only model\n      0.67\n    \n    \n      Bureau-only model\n      0.69\n    \n    \n      Combined model\n      0.73\n    \n  \n‍The uplift confirms that RiskSeal’s alternative data adds valuable context to bureau data, improving creditworthiness assessment.By capturing behavioral and digital patterns that traditional files often miss, the combined approach delivers a more accurate and inclusive view of risk.‍Robustness, limitations, and cautionEvery model has boundaries. It’s important to recognize where results should be interpreted with caution.Aggregation caveatThe pooled dataset of 6 million applications provides a strong overall signal. Still, some per-lender variation exists.Each institution serves different borrower segments and uses different product designs.For this reason, we recommend that partners run their own validation studies to confirm how the score performs in their specific portfolio.Default harmonizationFor this study, default outcomes from seven lenders were harmonized into a single definition to make pooled analysis possible.While this process minimizes noise, minor differences in reporting practices may remain. These should not affect the broad pattern but are worth keeping in mind.External factorsDefaults can shift in absolute terms due to external conditions, from promotional lending campaigns to macroeconomic shocks or seasonal borrowing patterns.These can temporarily change the level of risk across portfolios. That said, the relative ordering of risk bands remains stable, which is what matters most for decision-making.Predictive, not causalFinally, the digital score is a predictive tool.It identifies correlations between digital footprints and repayment behavior. It does not claim to explain or prove causal mechanisms behind borrower defaults.Lenders should view it as a powerful predictor, but not a standalone explanation for why people borrow or default.‍Practical recommendationsFor lenders considering adoption, the following steps provide a clear path to implementation:Run a proof-of-concept. Test the score on a recent 5,000-20,000 application sample to measure default rates by band within your portfolio.Apply banded operations. Define clear actions for each range - enhanced monitoring, manual reviews, or automated workflows.Layer with bureau data. Use the digital score alongside bureau information to strengthen discrimination and enrich existing models.Track drift. Monitor band-level default rates over time and recalibrate thresholds monthly during high-volume lending periods.This checklist ensures that the score is validated and operationalized in a way that adapts to portfolio realities and market shifts.‍ConclusionAcross 6 million applications scored at seven Mexican lenders, the RiskSeal Digital Credit Score proved strong and consistent in predicting default risk.Default rates fell sharply along the score range from 52% in the lowest band (0–99) to just 5% in the highest (900–999).The evidence is clear: the digital score reliably separates high-risk borrowers from those with solid repayment potential.But the impact goes beyond accuracy. Digital scoring brings a new layer of visibility. It captures behavioral and financial patterns that reveal real borrower behavior.This shift matters. It helps lenders reach borrowers who were once invisible to the credit system, while controlling risk with greater precision. This redefines how creditworthiness is measured.The future of credit isn’t just about more data. It’s about making lending more inclusive for applicants and safer for credit providers.At RiskSeal, this research marks an important milestone, but not the finish line. We’ll continue deepening our understanding of digital risk signals, refining while expanding to new markets.Improve your credit scoring accuracyWith Data EnrichmentBook a DemoBook a DemoFAQNo items found.See moreTop Risks BNPL Companies Must Tackle to Stay Competitive in 2026 Discover the top risks BNPL providers must tackle, from fraud to thin files, to stay competitive and compliant in 2026.Read moreHow Data Enrichment Helps Lenders Approve More with Less RiskLearn how data enrichment enhances credit risk models by filling gaps, spotting fraud early, and supporting inclusive lending.Read moreWhat Risk Scoring Is and Why It Is Critical for Modern LendersLearn how risk scoring enhances lending by assessing credit risk using traditional & alternative data.Read moreReady to chat?Book a demoBook a demoThank you!
