There’s a huge shift in how payments are made – but until NOTYD was started, it seemed like nobody had managed to bring B2B payments into the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoert Snyman\n\n\n\nSenior Analyst at NOTYD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Solution\n\n\n\nTo streamline their credit scoring process, NOTYD turned to SEON’s digital footprinting capabilities. The integration was impressively swift and straightforward.\n\n\n\n\nWe were looking at another provider, but they came back to us with a 4-6 months integration window. With SEON, it was literally a phone call, sandbox tests on Monday and by the end of the week, it was doneCoert Snyman\n\n\n\n\nSEON’s pricing model also appealed to NOTYD.\n\n\n\n\n“The SEON model, it’s now one we actively look for with our other partners. Clearly an organization that approaches work and its customers in a different way.”\n\n\n\nNOTYD leverages SEON’s digital footprinting during the customer identification process, where they can immediately filter out obvious fraudsters with no digital or social profiles. Additionally, NOTYD’s data science team uses data from SEON’s emails, phones, IPs, and device lookups to enhance their credit scoring system by creating in-depth no-code custom rules with a combination of SEON and NOTYD’s data.\n\n\n\n\nThe email analysis tool is fantastic in B2B because we work with a lot of custom emails. We create custom SEON rules, test them, and combine them with credit bureau data to build our own fuzzy logic. It accelerates credit scoring down to under a minute, with zero added friction.Coert Snyman\n\n\n\n\n\nDecrease Manual Review Times by up to 93%\nAllow rapid decision making for a frictionless onboarding experience.

Fraud is an issue faced by the whole industry and Revolut has made significant investments in its systems, processes and people to ensure that it protects its customers as it scales and grows.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore SEON\n\n\n\n\nLack of CNAME data and digital footprinting\n\n\n\nTrying to scale globally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith SEON\n\n\n\n\nCNAME data and digital footprinting data\n\n\n\nSuccessfully scaling globally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nAs a major player in the financial sector, Revolut faces the ever-present threat of fraud, a challenge that affects the entire industry. The company is dedicated to safeguarding its customers while expanding its global operations. To scale effectively, Revolut needed a solution that could enhance its risk models and provide better fraud prevention without compromising the customer experience.\n\n\n\nDmitri Lihhatsov, Fincrime Product Owner at Revolut, explains how the company fights back:\n\n\n\n“We have an incredible FinCrime team, continually updating and improving our strategy around keeping Revolut and our customers safe. Our data scientists are currently working on improving our global risk model because we have different configurations fo the United States, Great Britain and worldwide users. All this is part of our unique approach to fighting financial crime and fraud at Revolut.”\n\n\n\nDmitri Lihhatsov, Fincrime Product Owner at Revolut, and his team were looking for more data to bolster their machine-learning models and support their proactive approach to fraud prevention.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nAnd the key to better risk models?

From humble beginnings with just seven employees, the company has grown into a leading online iGaming operator active across four continents, with over 19 million customers. \n\n\n\nAt the heart of Lottoland’s success is its unwavering focus on the customer, prioritizing a seamless customer experience above all. Lottoland’s diverse product range includes over 30 lotteries across the world and over 300 games such as scratchcards, blackjack, roulette, slots and its latest addition, sports betting.\n\n\n\nWhat truly sets Lottoland apart is its collaborative, creative spirit. By fostering open communication across departments and always prioritizing customer needs, the company continuously strives to implement the best solutions to deliver exceptional user experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore SEON\n\n\n\n\nFraudulent players access during onboarding\n\n\n\nAccount takeover, bonus abuse and chargeback fraud\n\n\n\nSigniciant manual effort to mitigate fraud\n\n\n\nCompromising of user experience & disruption of the player journey\n\n\n\nLimited data insights & the absense of ML pattern detection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith SEON\n\n\n\n\nReal-time player registration monitoring\n\n\n\nMinimising disruption to genuine players\n\n\n\nBlock suspicious activity at onboarding\n\n\n\nAutomation and efficiency improvements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Challenge\n\n\n\nDespite Lottoland’s growth, the company encountered several fraud-related challenges that negatively impacted player satisfaction and hampered operational efficiencies:\n\n\n\n\nOnboarding Vulnerabilities: The primary issue was the onboarding process allowed fraudulent players access to the platform. Significant manual effort was used to mitigate this. Still, it took time in which there was the potential for bad actors to take advantage of promotional offers, impacting both Lottoland & legitimate customers.\n\n\n\nPersistent Fraud Issues: Lottoland grappled with recurring fraud issues, including account takeover (ATO), bonus abuse and chargeback fraud.\n\n\n\nInefficiencies in Fraud Detection: The process of detecting and blocking fraudulent accounts at the registration stage was heavily reliant on manual reviews and back-office reports. This reliance led to significant inefficiencies, compromising the user experience and disrupting the player journey. \n\n\n\nLimitations in Fraud Analysis: Reviews by the fraud and risk teams were subjective, hampered by limited data insights and the absence of machine-learning-based pattern detection. This lack of advanced technology hindered the processing of large data sets and the ability to identify anomalies quickly and accurately.\n\n\n\n\nAs a company committed to responsible gambling and regulatory compliance, fraud put Lottoland’s reputation and potential for growth at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe came across an account that was exhibiting abnormal behavior. We requested reports from our back-office team to understand more information about the player’s IP address. It took us a few days to piece together that the customer experienced an ATO attack and to identify all of the accounts involved. By that time, the customer experienced a loss, and so did we.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichie Burton\n\n\n\nHead of Player Protection, Lottoland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Solution\n\n\n\nIn its search for a comprehensive fraud solution, Lottoland focused on criteria that reflected its customer-centric values:\n\n\n\n\nPreventing ATO and multi-accounting to maintain a secure iGaming environment\n\n\n\nMinimizing bonus abuse to safeguard marketing investments\n\n\n\nOptimizing fraud detection efficiency while ensuring a frictionless customer experience\n\n\n\n\nSEON’s fraud prevention platform distinguished itself from competitors with its user-friendly and intuitive interface, real-time data capabilities, and an advanced machine learning-backed rules engine. The API-first approach and continuous support from SEON’s team of dedicated, knowledgeable fraud experts further confirmed their choice.\n\n\n\nThe Results\n\n\n\nImplementing SEON’s solution has empowered Lottoland to proactively combat fraud while upholding their commitment to exceptional customer experiences:\n\n\n\nSuccessful Fraud Prevention and Mitigation:\n\n\n\n\n32x ROI  by safeguarding marketing campaigns from bonus abuse\n\n\n\n190% increase in multi-accounting detection at registration\n\n\n\n10% increase in stopping fraudulent sign-ups \n\n\n\n\nOperational Improvements:\n\n\n\n\n50-hour-per-week reduction in investigating fraud across various teams including customer success, legal and compliance thanks to automation from custom and machine learning-suggested rules\n\n\n\n\nOther notable improvements include shifting to real-time player registration monitoring and activities from delayed reporting.

      "date": "2025-06-02T09:54:28",
      "content": "With compliance requirements and expectations intensifying worldwide, the anti-money laundering (AML) market is forecast to grow from $2.92 billion in 2024 to $3.39 billion by 2025, climbing to nearly $6 billion by 2029.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis expansion is driven much by the globalization of financial services, the proliferation of digital payments and the increasing sophistication of financial crime — each demanding faster, smarter and more scalable compliance solutions.Regulatory scrutiny has kept pace with these shifts. In 2024 alone, financial institutions faced more than $3.2 billion in fines for AML-related violations. A particularly notable case involved TD Bank, which was penalized $3.09 billion for systemic AML failures, including delayed Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) filings and lapses in monitoring suspicious transactions. These enforcement actions underscore the financial risks of non-compliance as well as the operational vulnerabilities that can arise when companies fail to modernize.\n\n\n\nThe Pitfalls of Scaling with Homegrown Solutions\n\n\n\nMany organizations, especially in rapid growth phases, attempt to scale their internal fraud and AML systems using homegrown solutions. While this approach may offer initial flexibility or cost savings, built solutions often struggle to keep pace with the complexity and scale of modern financial operations. Outdated monitoring tools, manual processes, stale and siloed data can yield operational bottlenecks, delayed SAR filings and regulatory non-compliance.Industry research suggests that up to 95% of system-generated AML alerts are false positives, overwhelming compliance teams and diverting attention from real threats. These limitations become especially apparent during rapid expansion or when entering new markets. Organizations risk critical failures without scalable architecture, robust audit trails and clearly defined service level agreements (SLAs). The TD Bank case is a cautionary tale, but not unique; it reflects a broader industry trend where compliance deficiencies are met with quick and severe regulatory action.\n\n\n\nReal-Time Customer Screening: A Critical Differentiator\n\n\n\nIn today’s environment, real-time customer screening is emerging as a key differentiator for organizations striving for sustainable compliance. Businesses can identify and block suspicious activity by continuously evaluating individuals and entities against regularly refreshed global watchlists, politically exposed persons (PEPs) databases, sanctions lists, crime records and adverse media sources directly from official sources.\n\n\n\nSmart Screening in Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern AML solutions do more than surface obvious risks; they enable preemptive customer screening strategies that filter out suspicious users even before onboarding. For example, organizations can restrict access before a new customer is onboarded from high-risk jurisdictions based on IP analysis or flag profiles with weak digital footprints and unusual device configurations. This early intervention reduces downstream screening workloads, protects systems from malicious access and helps save money on KYC costs.Real-time customer screening solutions automate risk checks, streamline onboarding and ensure continuous monitoring. Intelligent automation filters alerts and surfaces high-confidence matches using fuzzy logic, edit distance thresholds and dynamic scoring — helping teams prioritize what truly matters.\n\n\n\nThese technologies integrate both fraud and AML monitoring seamlessly via APIs, allowing businesses to define customer risk thresholds, customize monitoring frequencies and adapt to evolving regulatory requirements without delay. Whether screening at onboarding or maintaining weekly or on-change monitoring across jurisdictions, compliance teams can scale programs with precision backed by comprehensive audit trails documenting every action.\n\n\n\nThis shift from reactive checks to proactive, automated monitoring transforms how organizations approach AML compliance. Real-time customer screening enables smarter decisions, reduces operational drag and provides a defensible framework for meeting global regulations as businesses grow and diversify.\n\n\n\nThe Value of Specialized Partnerships\n\n\n\nSustainable compliance requires more than technology. It demands partnerships with specialized vendors who understand the regulatory landscape and provide proven, scalable solutions. Externally supported platforms offer technical expertise, robust SLAs, continuous product updates and dedicated support, ensuring that compliance programs remain resilient as organizations grow.\n\n\n\nBy working with experienced partners, organizations can bridge operational gaps and future-proof their compliance efforts. Integrated fraud and AML platforms that combine real-time customer screening with transaction monitoring, automated reporting and unified case management help reduce costs, enhance detection and protect against internal and external threats.

      "date": "2025-06-17T09:20:23",
      "content": "In the current compliance environment, where regulatory pressure is rising and teams are stretched thin, efficiency can’t be left to chance. When alert fatigue becomes the norm, compliance teams are forced to navigate noise instead of actual risk, and the consequences of missing a real threat grow steeper by the day. \n\n\n\nFor anti-money laundering (AML) programs, structured workflows and alert optimization, enhancing suspicious activity detection, are the strongest levers to improve operational output and decision quality. Done well, these can shift teams from reactive firefighting to proactive risk resolution. Done poorly, they lead to bottlenecks, missed risks and mounting overhead (not to mention subsequent penalties).\n\n\n\nWhere Structure Meets Consistency & Control\n\n\n\nA well-structured workflow removes ambiguity from investigations. Analysts don’t waste time deciding what to do next — instead, they follow defined steps that match the nature of the alert. For example, politically exposed person (PEP) alerts and unusual transaction patterns merit review, but require different levels of documentation, escalation and data collection. Checklists tailored to each alert type ensure the proper process is followed every time.This structure enhances consistency, reduces errors and removes individual bias from investigations. It also strengthens auditability: when every step is captured and includes notes, reviewed and timestamped, teams can demonstrate the rigor of their work to regulators. During high-volume periods, checklists reduce the risk of missed steps and simplify collaboration across teams, creating a shared language for complex decisions.\n\n\n\nBut structure alone isn’t enough. Efficiency also depends on assigning the right work to the right people. Specific alerts — such as those involving high-value transactions or suspicious digital behavior — should be routed to analysts with particular expertise. Intelligent automated triage helps maintain balance to avoid alert fatigue and ensure that high-risk cases get fast, expert attention.\n\n\n\nOptimizing Alerts the Smart Way\n\n\n\nAlert optimization is about ensuring analysts focus on what matters, combating financial crimes and money laundering, and not chasing noise. That means tuning rule logic to only the most relevant triggers to prompt alerts. Maintaining an alert-to-transaction ratio within a 5–10% threshold is a widely cited best practice to balance effectiveness and efficiency. However, regulators also expect institutions to calibrate thresholds based on their specific risk profile and ongoing tuning. Staying within this range cuts down on false positives and ensures that analysts’ time is actually spent on the most relevant cases instead of digging for information across siloed spreadsheets, emails and message threads. It also signals that the most relevant case monitoring rules are correctly tuned. Excessive alert volumes may indicate noisy rules and overwhelm teams, undermining efficiency and being perceived as poor compliance processes by regulators.Practical tips for tuning alerts include grouping similar triggers to reduce redundancies, avoiding overlaps between rules to prevent duplicate alerts, prioritizing alerts by risk level and confidence score (making sure that higher-risk alerts are reviewed first), and regularly reviewing and adjusting thresholds to maintain the desired alert-to-transaction ratios over time. Tuning strategies should be governed by compliance leads or AML officers and reviewed periodically through governance processes, ensuring continuous alignment with regulatory expectations and institutional risk appetite.\n\n\n\nModern Case Management: Driving Efficiency and Accountability\n\n\n\nAnother piece of the efficiency puzzle is modern case management. A centralized case management software is the operational heart of an AML program, tying together risk signals, transaction history, alerts, analyst notes, investigations and regulatory reporting. With everything in one place, teams gain visibility into a case’s full lifecycle, from first flag to resolution. \n\n\n\nIntegrated case management enables collaboration without duplication, while customizable checklists ensure consistency. Each case builds its audit trail — a critical feature in regulated industries — capturing every action and decision in real time for regulators, auditors and internal oversight. Automation plays a key role here, too. Tasks like assigning alerts based on workload, risk type or analyst role can be fully automated, keeping workload balanced, especially during spikes in alert volumes or staffing limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecision in Practice\n\n\n\nA practical example is an alert triggered by a login from a new device tied to a user with a sparse digital footprint. On its own, this may not scream “money laundering,” but layered with velocity indicators or geolocation anomalies, it can signal account takeover or mule activity. Likewise, patterns such as structuring, smurfing, or ...",

      "date": "2025-06-10T16:38:12",
      "content": "The iGaming industry treats bonus abuse as a nuisance — an inevitable cost of doing business, rather than the structural vulnerability it is. Operators spend millions acquiring users only to hand over revenue to fraudsters who exploit predictable incentives and inadequate protection measures.Meanwhile, the most effective abusers aren’t the risk-takers or amateurs; they’re engineers collecting paychecks from fraud rings and other scheme masters. The industry is losing a technical arms race it barely acknowledges exists. Bonus abuse has surpassed its “bad actor” problem, evolving into a pervasive issue that exposes how outdated many operators’ fraud prevention strategies have become.\n\n\n\nFraudsters Aren’t Getting Lucky — They’re Getting Smarter\n\n\n\nMulti-accounting, identity spoofing and synthetic ID creation are not fringe tactics. They’re increasingly automated, scalable and powered by commercial-grade infrastructure. Fraudsters now deploy residential proxy networks, manipulate browser and device fingerprints, and use AI models to simulate betting patterns. These are not opportunistic attacks; they are technically sophisticated, continuous operations.\n\n\n\nConsider the modern abuse toolkit. Scripts auto-generate new accounts using fake identities. Fingerprint spoofing frameworks bypass device fingerprinting. Synthetic documents produced by generative AI sail through weak verification systems. Betting behaviors are shaped by models trained on legitimate user data to evade statistical detection. This isn’t gambling — it’s precision engineering. And operators still leaning on rigid rules or basic KYC checks are bringing a knife to a gunfight.\n\n\n\nThe Real Costs Are Strategic\n\n\n\nBonus abuse can drain more than promotional budgets: it distorts KPIs, inflates CACs and poisons the data that drives customer retention strategies. A fraudster disguised as a “new user” pollutes segmentation models, corrupts LTV forecasts and erodes trust in marketing attribution. Worse, once flagged on one platform, these users often resurface elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe impact isn’t limited to fraud teams. It’s a cross-functional problem. Marketing teams celebrate new user spikes. Product teams interpret churn through a faulty lens. Finance sees unaccountable leakage in acquisition spend. It stems from the same core issue: treating technical fraud as a marketing side effect rather than a business-critical risk.\n\n\n\nEmerging Battleground: Agentic AI\n\n\n\nUnlike other waves of automation, agentic AI is empowering fraudsters to orchestrate complex, multi-step attacks with little to no human oversight. These AI-driven bots can autonomously create synthetic identities, manage fleets of accounts and adapt tactics in real time to bypass evolving defenses. In practice, this means bonus abuse is no longer just a matter of opportunistic actors exploiting predictable incentives; it has become a high-tech arms race, with fraud rings leveraging agentic AI to industrialize abuse at unprecedented speed and scale. Automated betting bots, virtual machines and simulated IP addresses are beginning to be coordinated by agentic systems to systematically exploit promotional offers, draining operator resources and distorting user data with minimal risk of detection.In response, many leading iGaming operators are beginning to deploy agentic AI on the defensive front, moving beyond static rules and traditional KYC checks, into layering behavioral biometrics, device intelligence and real-time anomaly detection. Agentic AI can autonomously flag suspicious activity, trigger dynamic verification flows and even preemptively block coordinated abuse attempts, without slowing down legitimate players. This shift mirrors trends across enterprise sectors, where agentic AI is redefining automation by executing complex workflows independently and continuously learning from adversarial behavior.\n\n\n\nWithin iGaming, the adoption of agentic AI is a strategic imperative to keep pace with adversaries who are already wielding these tools. As the bonus abuse problem evolves, the battle lines are increasingly drawn between agentic AI systems weaponized by fraudsters and those deployed by operators determined to protect their platforms and players.\n\n\n\niGaming Needs to Build for Adversarial Thinking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most successful fraud prevention systems don’t attempt to wall off every threat. Instead, they accept that fraud is dynamic and designed for adaptation. This often means layering signals — device intelligence, behavioral biometrics, session monitoring, transaction monitoring, anomaly detection — and integrating them in real time. It means looking for the shape of behavior, not just static indicators.\n\n\n\nProgressive security frameworks like tiered KYC or adaptive and dynamic friction models are far more effective than binary, upfront verification. These technologies can protect margins without choking the user experience by aligning security checks with risk exposure. Since fraudsters are patie...",

      "author": "Jeremy Doyle\nDirector Growth, AML Solutions",
      "date": "2025-02-24T15:59:21",
      "content": "Money laundering exists to do one thing: to disguise dirty money as clean. But in doing so, it quietly erodes trust in the global financial system. For regulated institutions, the sheer complexity of laundering schemes makes it notoriously difficult to detect, investigate and report.To stay ahead, financial organizations and other regulated entities rely on anti-money laundering (AML) measures like customer and payment screening, transaction monitoring and real-time tracking to do more than strictly comply — they are essential to identifying and stopping everything from organized crime to terrorist financing.\n\n\n\nBy the end of last year, AML and sanctions-related fines topped $45.7 billion since the start of the 21st century. Regulated entities are responding with real-time AML case management systems that streamline investigations, improve efficiency, and make compliance a proactive defense against financial crime.\n\n\n\nWhat is AML Case Management?\n\n\n\nAML case management offers regulated organizations a structured, real-time approach to identifying, investigating, and reporting suspicious activities directly to regulatory bodies like FinCEN. By centralizing alerts and customer data, modern systems help compliance teams move away from outdated manual processes and spreadsheet-driven tasks, enabling analysts to focus more efficiently on critical compliance matters. The shift to intuitive, user-friendly interfaces marks a key improvement in compliance operations, significantly reducing manual workload and allowing teams to concentrate on high-risk cases with greater strategic focus.\n\n\n\nHow Does an AML Case Management System Work?\n\n\n\nSEON’s AML case management software centralizes all relevant customer information, linking alerts, transactions and risk profiles within one unified platform. Utilizing real-time digital footprint analysis, device intelligence and precise fraud signals, SEON enables informed risk decisions that give analysts the insight to close out alerts and cases faster.\n\n\n\nCompliance teams can efficiently detect suspicious behaviors through a transparent and customizable alert dashboard, managing investigations collaboratively with built-in notes and tailored checklists.\n\n\n\nAlerts can be assigned directly to analysts with specific skill sets or automatically balanced across team members, ensuring timely reviews and reducing alert fatigue. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, SEON’s highly granular, no-code rule capabilities allow precise detection and easy adjustment of thresholds, risk signals and alert triggers, significantly reducing false positives.\n\n\n\nWhen regulatory reporting is required, SEON simplifies the process by auto-populating SARs, CTRs, and Form 8300, ensuring direct, timely filing with authorities like FinCEN, thus eliminating manual data entry and minimizing compliance risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Smarter AML Case Management\n  Streamline alerts, investigations, and workflows with SEON’s AML tools for faster case resolution and SAR filings.\n  \n    Explore the Software\n  \n\n\n\n\nDefining an Efficient AML Case Management Solution\n\n\n\nAn efficient AML case management software combines real-time, direct-to-source data with advanced technological innovation, uniting AML and fraud detection and prevention within one solution – often under the beloved or polarizing ‘FRAML’ moniker. With fraud and compliance data in one place, teams can connect the dots faster to quickly unveil potential risks and patterns that might otherwise remain obscured.\n\n\n\nIntegrating transparent artificial intelligence (AI), along with device intelligence, digital footprint analysis and customizable machine learning algorithms, not only identifies irregularities but also provides transparent rationales based on rules triggered behind the generated alerts to demystify decision-making processes, allowing analysts to understand and trust the AI’s recommendations, transitioning from cumbersome, manual processes to streamlined, intelligent systems. \n\n\n\nCase management systems should also incorporate intuitive workflow optimization. For instance, when creating an alert trigger, analysts can assign alerts directly to individuals with the appropriate skill sets, ensuring immediate expert review. If an alert isn’t explicitly assigned, the system intelligently auto-assigns it to the analyst with the fewest active alerts, maintaining balanced workloads.\n\n\n\nThese workflow enhancements, alongside other features like pre-populated SARs, CTRs and Form 8300s, detailed investigative insights, generative AI-driven SAR narratives and direct one-click filing with FinCEN, ensure both efficiency and rigorous regulatory compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is AML Compliance?\n\n\n\nAML compliance is the framework that enables regulated entities to detect, prevent and report financial crimes. At its core, AML compliance includes four critical components: AML screening, ongoing monitoring, payment screening and transaction monitoring. Together, these functions form a comprehensive defense...",

      "content": "Financial criminals constantly evolve, employing advanced technologies and increasingly complex tactics to evade detection. Fraud insights gathered across onboarding, logins, monitoring and transactions hold immense value by revealing user intent. When siloed, however, these insights remain confined within fraud teams, missing the opportunity to enhance AML efforts. Key indicators – like understanding IP addresses from high-risk jurisdictions, device anomalies or atypical customer behaviors – often go unshared, limiting the potential to accelerate AML investigations and support regulatory reporting.\n\n\n\nFraud and money laundering are closely interlinked, with fraud serving as the precursor to laundering schemes. Yet, teams that address these issues traditionally operate in isolation with minimal knowledge or data-sharing. Integrating fraud data signals into AML workflows can grant teams a more comprehensive view of customer behavior, streamlining investigations, accelerating alert resolutions and strengthening compliance efforts. This united approach can equip organizations to address financial crime with greater efficiency, precision and cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n\nA Unified Approach to Fraud and AML Investigations\n\n\n\nTo counter criminal networks, organizations must unify fraud detection with AML processes in a seamless, collaborative framework. Bridging silos offers three key advantages:\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced Risk Detection and Contextual Awareness: Integrating fraud insights into AML processes enriches investigations with contextual clues not visible from AML data alone. By connecting fraud indicators (e.g., IP anomalies or shared devices across accounts) with AML data, teams gain a clearer picture of user intent and suspicious patterns, improving accuracy and reducing false positives.\n\n\n\nImproved Collaboration and Transparency: When fraud and AML teams share a unified solution, collaboration becomes more intuitive. Both teams gain access to relevant data, streamlining the tracking of suspicious activities and facilitating communication on complex cases. This integration reduces blind spots, revealing hidden networks and risk factors that a fragmented system might overlook.\n\n\n\nIncreased Efficiency and Cost Savings: Consolidating efforts within a single solution eliminates the need to switch between different systems, reducing the duplication of effort and data transfer issues. Visibility across fraud and AML data signals provides missing context for teams to identify and address risk faster, reducing investigation time and lowering compliance costs through increased productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Out Fraudsters Before AML Screening: A Cost-Effective First Line of Defense\n\n\n\nBefore AML teams initiate screening, organizations should focus on blocking fraudsters from onboarding processes. Fraud detection tools that analyze digital footprints and device signals can spot suspicious users right from the start. Indicators such as the absence of a verifiable online presence, use of anonymizing browsers, email age, data breach exposure and suspect device configurations offer valuable insights into potential fraudsters.\n\n\n\nBy intercepting high-risk users early, businesses can avoid the costs associated with AML/KYC checks, preserving resources and maintaining customer base integrity. This proactive approach reduces the financial burden of managing high-risk users in AML workflows, allowing teams to focus on legitimate customers with reduced risk of costly remediation.\n\n\n\nKey Fraud Insights for AML Teams\n\n\n\nFraud insights supply value across the entire compliance operations process – not just onboarding – enhancing AML efforts by delivering essential context for investigations. Here’s how specific fraud data signals support different stages of compliance:\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\n\nUse Case: Onboarding, Payment Screening and Transaction MonitoringAnalyzing IP addresses helps identify users from restricted or high-risk jurisdictions. During onboarding, IP analysis prevents high-risk individuals from entering the system, while in payment screening and transaction monitoring, it flags unauthorized access and suspicious payment destinations, assisting in identifying potential money laundering routes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Addresses & Phone Numbers\n\nUse Case: OnboardingEmail and phone number analysis can reveal synthetic identities or disposable contacts often used by fraudsters. Users with limited online presence linked to their contact details may be flagged as high-risk, as legitimate users typically have an established digital footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Age\n\nUse Case: OnboardingEvaluating the age of an email account – through data breach records – provides a view into authenticity. Established emails with longer histories are generally considered more trustworthy, while newly created emails may indicate higher fraud risk, allowing teams to filter at the onboarding stage before users make it to AML screening.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevice Fingerprinting\n\nUse Case: On...",

      "content": "Imagine searching for a needle in a haystack, while even more hay keeps piling on top. That’s the daily reality for AML analysts drowning in hundreds (if not thousands) of alerts. False positives and low-priority alerts can clog workflows, leading to inefficiencies and burnout. This overwhelming cycle fuels alert fatigue, and with analysts tied up handling irrelevant alerts, real risks inevitably slip through.\n\n\n\nCompanies need smarter strategies that prioritize accuracy and high-quality alerting over sheer volume. By focusing on precision, teams can cut through the noise and ensure genuine threats get the attention they deserve.\n\n\n\nHow High Alert Volumes Hurt Your Business\n\n\n\nWhen analysts are flooded with alerts, it becomes harder to spot genuine threats. Critical signals can get buried in noise, giving bad actors more time to move funds, create synthetic identities or layer transactions unnoticed.\n\n\n\nAnd when the team eventually catches on, it may be too late, leading to serious consequences. Burnout from nonstop notifications results in higher error rates and reduced job satisfaction, weakening an organization’s ability to detect and prevent fraud and money laundering. Excessive alerts not only impact analysts but also degrade customer trust. Frequent false positives can delay transaction approvals and account reviews, eroding trust and driving customers to competitors. \n\n\n\nRegulators closely scrutinize how alerts are managed. When systems generate excessive alerts without timely resolution, it signals poor compliance practices. Alert backlogs can delay filing suspicious activity reports (SARs) or currency transaction reports (CTRs), increasing the risk of fines, reputational damage, and heightened regulatory attention. An overwhelmed alert system hampers operational efficiency and invites deeper investigations from authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Risk-Based Alert Triggers\n\n\n\nThe key to tackling alert fatigue is to reduce alert volume while focusing on the most relevant, high-risk signals. To do so, trigger creation must be thoughtful, moving away from outdated or broad parameters and instead identifying patterns and behaviors unique to your organization.By connecting the dots and building precise, effective alert systems, you can ensure that only genuine risks are flagged, allowing teams to focus on what matters most. Here’s how to go about building smarter alert triggers: \n\n\n\n1. Draw Up Risk Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe first step is understanding what happens in your business — define events that require investigation and false alarms that clog the workflow. Analyze past fraud and money laundering cases and trends to identify patterns and keep your focus on genuinely suspicious activities rather than harmless anomalies.\n\n\n\n\nScenario: Multiple transactions slightly under reporting thresholds indicating potential structuring.\n\n\n\nRecommended Alert: Trigger an alert when a customer initiates more than five transactions within a 24-hour period, where each transaction falls within 90–99% of the reporting threshold (e.g. $9,800–$9,999 if the threshold is $10,000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Map AML Regulations and Procedures\n\n\n\nCreate alert triggers based on your jurisdiction’s AML requirements and your organization’s specific risk controls. For example, you can set alert triggers for suspicious activities such as:\n\n\n\n\nUnusually large transactions that exceed standard thresholds: Transactions surpassing an account’s typical activity or industry norms may indicate money laundering or illicit fund transfers. Establishing thresholds based on customer profiles and transaction history helps reduce false positives.\n\n\n\nConnections to high-risk jurisdictions or sanctioned entities: Transactions involving countries with weak AML enforcement, such as Afghanistan, Myanmar, or Haiti, known financial crime hubs like Cyprus or the British Virgin Islands, or individuals on international sanctions lists require enhanced scrutiny. Organizations can reduce regulatory risks and avoid potential compliance violations by screening against updated watchlists in real time and monitoring IP data to verify customer location.\n\n\n\n\n3. Use Historic Data and Machine Learning\n\n\n\nSEON lets you create alert triggers using existing rules, integrating them into risk scoring powered by machine learning. You can build new detection mechanisms by leveraging proven templates from past cases while preserving core logic. This streamlines setup and ensures alerts remain precise and reliable.\n\n\n\n\nClone and modify high-performing rules with adjusted thresholds: Identify rules that consistently detect suspicious activity and fine-tune their thresholds to reduce false positives or adapt to emerging threats.\n\n\n\nCreate composite triggers by combining multiple existing rules: Strengthen money laundering detection by linking multiple conditions, such as transaction velocity, device intelligence and user behavior, to improve accuracy and context awareness.\n\n\n\nAdapt rules across different...",

While building a cryptocurrency startup, they faced relentless fraud attacks that threatened the company’s survival. Frustrated by slow, complex anti-fraud tools that hurt user experience, they set out to build something radically different: an agile, transparent, data-rich platform capable of stopping fraud without blocking growth.\n\n\n\nNearly a decade later, SEON protects over 5,000 businesses globally and has prevented more than $300 billion in fraud losses. With a team of 300+ fraud experts across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, SEON combines world-class engineering with deep industry insight.\n\n\n\nPowered by more than 900 real-time, first-party data signals and an adaptable AI rules engine, SEON is the command center for real-time risk and AML decision-making, helping businesses detect hidden threats, automate compliance and deliver seamless customer experiences. From fintech and payments to eCommerce and iGaming, SEON enables teams to move fast without compromising security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$300bn\n\n\n\nsaved in fraud prevention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+15mn\n\n\n\ndaily transactions secured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5000+\n\n\n\nbusinesses served globally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Milestones\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviousNext\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2025 SEPTEMBER\n\n\n\nSeries C funding round (w/ lead investor, Sixth Street)\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2025 JULY\n\n\n\nCNBC’s World’s Top Fintech Companies (3rd year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2025 JUNE\n\n\n\n$300B+ in fraud and money laundering stopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2025 MAY\n\n\n\nSingapore office opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2024 DECEMBER\n\n\n\nSEON reaches 300 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2022 APRIL\n\n\n\nSeries B funding (w/ lead investor, IVP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2022 APRIL\n\n\n\nSEON reaches 200 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nOCTOBER 2021\n\n\n\nJakarta office opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2021 JULY\n\n\n\nSEON reaches 100 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2021 MAY\n\n\n\nAustin office opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2021 MARCH\n\n\n\nSeries A funding round (w/ lead investor, Creandum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2020 AUGUST\n\n\n\nBudapest office opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2020 MARCH\n\n\n\nLondon office opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n2017 JANUARY\n\n\n\nSEON founded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet to Know Our Team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTamás Kádár\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBence Jendruszák\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela Pierce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCFO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt DeLauro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident, GTM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaun Worley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Lipton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCTO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevlyn Coelho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Gunn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSVP Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonna Fowler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSVP, Global People and Talent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLillian Ipsen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVP Success Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Szilvia Pogány\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVP of Legal and Compliance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMárk Pálfalvi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard Member\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimon Schmincke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard Member\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarthik Ramakrishnan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard Member\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Bauer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard Member\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Offices\n\n\n\n\nWith offices in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, we serve thousands of companies worldwide across multiple time zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustin\n\n\n\nBond Collective, 310 Comal Street 2nd floor, Austin, TX 78702, United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLondon\n\n\n\n10 York RdLondon, SE1 7ND, United Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudapest\n\n\n\nRákóczi út 42, 1072 Budapest, Hungary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPAC\n\n\n\nRevenue Tower, Jalan Jend.
